# WordPress Quick Links - Chrome Extension

This was a fun project created to save time when I was a product developer and getting support requests for different language websites. It was difficult to navigate through the WordPress dashboard for non-English websites. 

This code is written several years ago and can be optimized. PR are welcome.
